I’m trying to write a very simple dice game where the computer simulates two players each throwing dice.
The higher score wins and after a (selectable) number of turns the player who’s won most times wins the game.
(I’m going to make the game cleverer once it’s working.)
But the games always seem to be drawn and I can’t see why.
Here is what the program produces:

    dice_game
    Let's play dice
    How many turns? 10
    Drawn!
    How many turns? 8
    Drawn!
    How many turns? ^D

What’s going wrong, and how might you help the programmer find the problem?
As usual, there may be other suggestions you might make of some other possible things
to (re-)consider about their program.
