Code Critique 108
-----------------

I've got a problem with an extra colon being produced in the output from a program.
I've stripped down the files involved in the program a fair bit to this smaller example.
Here is what the program produces:

test_program Example "With space"
1:: 1001:Example
2:: "1002:With space"

I can't see where the two colons after each initial number come from as I only ask for one.

Please can you help the programmer find the cause of their problem and suggest some other possible
things to consider about their program.

The Problem
-----------

to_string(t), called in escaped_text(T t), always calls the inline override defined in record.h.
Even when an index of type int is passed as the argument, it is promoted to an instance of type
Record, calling the constructor, which accepts the index as a uint64_t for the id param, and
instantiates a default empty string into the normally expected value parameter.
Now, when Record::to_string() is called, the 'extra' colon is appended to the id, before the empty value.
The std version of to_string() is never called for the supplied index of type int.
