Code Critique 108
-----------------

I've got a problem with an extra colon being produced in the output from a program.
I've stripped down the files involved in the program a fair bit to this smaller example.
Here is what the program produces:

test_program Example "With space"
1:: 1001:Example
2:: "1002:With space"

I can't see where the two colons after each initial number come from as I only ask for one.

Please can you help the programmer find the cause of their problem and suggest some other possible
things to consider about their program.
