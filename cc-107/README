I want to collect the meals needed for attendees for a one-day event
so I’m reading lines of text with the name and a list of the meals needed,
and then writing the totals. However, the totals are wrong – but I can’t see why:

    > meals
    Roger breakfast lunch
    John lunch dinner
    Peter dinner

    Total: 3 breakfast: 3 lunch: 2 dinner: 2
There should only be 1 breakfast, not 3!

Please can you help the programmer find the bug – and suggest some possible improvements to the program!
